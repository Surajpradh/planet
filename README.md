This repository contains the scripts used to calculate the Habitogenesis Index (HI) and Probability of Abiogenesis (Pα) for exoplanets, as described in the manuscript “A Kinetics-Driven Framework for Quantifying Abiogenesis Potential on Terrestrial Exoplanets”.

The framework integrates:

Ocean temperature

Catalytic metal availability

Atmospheric retention (using argon fraction)

Reaction kinetics

to generate a quantitative ranking of exoplanets for potential abiogenesis.
